## How it works

My project ensures that all of the specified number switches are on, and all unspecified switches are off. I did this with a bunch of and gates and not gates, ensuring that if and only if all conditions were right does it turn the LED on. 

## How to test

The only way to get the LED to turn on is to have 1,2, and 7 all on at the same time.

## External hardware
